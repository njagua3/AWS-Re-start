# AWS-Re-start
A Linux distribution is a packaged version of Linux that a group of individuals or a company develops.

 It includes the core operating system functionality (kernel) and additional complementary tools and software applications.
 
 Examples of Linux distribution include Amazon Linux 2, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Debian, and Ubuntu.
 
 In the AWS Cloud, the Amazon Linux 2 operating system is readily distributed by using an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). An AMI contains an operating system and other pre-installed software relevant to the image. 

 # Linux Components
 Kernel - provides core functionality of os

 Daemons - provides extra support for system or user

 Applications - includes programs such as dbs, web browsers and text editors

 Data files - include user content such as music files. # how to name a file - [directory name]filenames[.extension] eg /picture/dog.gif

 Configuration files - has settings for linux, services 

 # Linux Kernel

 An operating system kernel is:
 
 –A computer program
 
 –A controller of everything in the operating system
 
 •The Linux kernel manages:
 
 –Scheduling of processor time
 
 –Memory allocation for the operating system and for applications
 
 –Access to peripheral devices (sound card, hard disk drive, network card, and others)

 # Functions of Linux Kernel

 -Resource allocation

 # Daemons
Computer programs that run in the background

 Are not under the control of an interactive user
 
 •Typically provide a system service
 
 •Process names that traditionally end with the letter d
 
 •Examples:–syslogd–sshd

 # Linux user interface

 CLI

 Provides more options
 most linux servers use only the CLI
 Can be automated with scripts
 consumes fewer hardware resources

 When you use the CLI, the shell that you select defines the list of commands and functions that you can run. 
 
 A shell interprets the command that you type and invokes the appropriate kernel component that runs the command. 
 
 You can use many types of shells, and each Linux distribution defines the types that it can support.
